# Feather Server - Private Server Project
A open source project for who wants to bring back the "[Destiny Online](https://www.mmorpg.com/destiny-online/screens)" (AKA Feather / 天羽 Online / 天羽传奇 for HK,TW/China).\
The chinese official website: [Here](http://tycq.laowaner.com/)

# Game Client
Due to the copyright issue, we cannot upload BOTH the game client by oursalves AND the language packs.\
(which means all the game infos will be in Chinese (Simplfied))\
\
To download the game client, you have to go to the official website:\
[http://tycq.laowaner.com/down/](http://tycq.laowaner.com/down/)\
Or\
Direct download link: [Direct Link](http://down.laowaner.com/tycq_v1.3.0.10.14.7z)\
\
(because the bandwidth for download is low, you are suggested to download it using BT downloader to speed it up.)

# The Progress So Far
After a few months, we have a large breakthrough about the game protocol. For more details, you can vitist [here](https://hackmd.io/@blackphreak/ryvhqScSS#Handshake).\
\
We also completed the Login, Register, Join Game, Character Action Sync (a portion) parts.\
And I decided to open source this project because I can't finish this project alone,
 since the game protocol take me months to find out how it works and what packets it take,
 and now I don't have time to work on those packet analysis.\
\
So, if you are really interested and want to own a private server yourself, please give us a hand,
 create some PRs (pull request) / issues to increase the progress of the server.

# Licensing
I don't really care the license problem, if you really want, just copy it or do whatever you want,\
 but, you have to push back the source code to this repo to contribute back to the others (at least for me, ofcuz :D).

# Conclusion
I am a lazy guy \_(:3 」∠ )_
